# Aquarium Project Dashboard

The Aquarium Project Dashboard is a maintainable, easy to use, and extensible tool that enables an Aquarium user (researcher, lab manager) to track the progress of a project in an Aquarium instance, where a project is defined as a set of linked plans (complementary workflows) to be executed on given samples and may be linked to an experimental request. This tool will be integrated with Aquarium as possible. Different types of projects (e.g., protein design, strain construction) will utilize visualizations.

Although Aquarium has no internal representation of the expected project schedule, the dashboard will have such a representation and some ability of comparing expected and actual completion dates.
